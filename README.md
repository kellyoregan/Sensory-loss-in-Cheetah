# Sensory-loss-in-Cheetah
Does the cheetah genome show ‘mutational meltdown’ through a high degree of sensory loss relative to other felids
Genomes will be taken from NCBI and olfactory receptor genes will be mined using Sensommatic (Ryan et al., 2024). I will determine percentage functional and non-functional olfactory receptor genes in the cheetah and compare to other members of the family Felinae with a Pantherin outgroup (Panthera tigris). The duplication rate of OR genes and specific loss events in the cheetah will be quantified and compared across species.
